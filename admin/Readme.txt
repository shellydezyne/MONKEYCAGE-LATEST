* Frequently Asked Questions
//================================================================================
:- Q1: The script wont make thumbnails! (Yes it will, but with your help).
:-		A1: Make sure the folder in which the files are in is chmod 777. Use your ftp client or site admin panel to do this.
:-		A2: Make sure the file you want the script to make a thumb of is either jpg, gih or png. This script will not make thumbs of any other file types.

:- Q2: I keep getting creating thumb errors. 
:-		A1: Maybe the folder is chmod 777. Please do this using your ftp client or site admin panel.
:-		A2: This script can only make thumbs of jpg or gif images. Any other image types this script will fail to make images of.

:- Q3: I cannot upload files to the folders I created in the admin panel.
:-		A1: Your server may have some security against the chmod() function. You will have to chmod each folder 777 with your ftp client or site admin panel. Sorry :(.
:-		A2: The file type of the uploaded file must be in the $show_files array in the settings of this script. Otherwise it will be denied.
